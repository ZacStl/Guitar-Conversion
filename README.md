# Guitar-Conversion

In this Thesis work, we present a system for augmenting the sound of a guitar by producing a synthetic sound layer using wavetable synthesis techniques. 
Core to the process is a real-time transcription mechanism that operates in a monophonic manner and accepts the guitar sound as input and there is no need for additional hardware. 


Running this GUI application it is essensial to have the attached wav files of this repository in the same folder and had imported the nessesery libraries that mentioned in the python file.
